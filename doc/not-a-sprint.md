# Not A Sprint - A Marathon

## How To Keep up

Here are some of the ways I use to keep my Python up-to-speed.

It's impossible to be totally up-to-date on everything, even if that's your full-time job...

---

## Keep Writing Code

You will look up solutions to problems you face and might encounter intersting new tech.

---

## Get Your Code Reviewed

Code Reviews are a great learning opportunity.

Different reviewers spot different issues at different levels.

---

## Read The Source Code

Read the source code of small libraries that interest you.

Try https://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi, for example.

---

## Start A Side Project!

Start a small project in a field that's unrelated to your job.

Present it at local un-conferences!

---

## See You In PyCon!

Conferences are a great place to network, and to see what's popular, and meet your celebrities.

PyCon Israel 2020 will probably be held in the beginning of June, but tickets run out months in advance. https://il.pycon.org/2019/

PyCon US is an amazing experience.

Smaller PyCons in specific states.

PyData conferences.

There are also good Python conferences in Europe.

## Meetups
